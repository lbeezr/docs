Pachyderm is a **data-centric pipelining and versioning tool** that allows ML and Data-Science teams to automate and collaborate on their organization's data while maintaining full reproducibility.

For a quick start, deploy Pachyderm on your [local machine](./local-installation/), on your [favorite cloud](../deploy-manage/deploy/quickstart/) provider, or get an [introduction to pachyderm](https://public-sandbox.workspace.pachyderm.com/){target=_blank data-clickid=docs-gettingstarted-sandbox} from your browser.
