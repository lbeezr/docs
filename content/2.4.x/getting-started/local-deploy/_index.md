Pachyderm is a data-centric pipeline and data versioning application written in go that runs on top of a Kubernetes cluster. A common way to interact with Pachyderm is by using Pachyderm command-line tool `pachctl`, from a terminal window. To check the state of your deployment, you will also need to install `kubectl`, Kubernetes command-line tool.
